Please read the file README in this directory for additional important
information on The DICT Development Group, this software, mailing lists, etc.

INSTALLATION
============

1.  Configure the source code and Makefiles:

        ./configure

    NOTE: the configure script accepts the common --prefix flag for
    installing the software in an installer-defined location.  For example,
    you can do something like:

        ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnu

2.  Compile the client and server software:

        make 

    NOTE: If you want to build only the client software, use 'make dict'
    instead of 'make'

    [If using the Cygwin tools under Win98, please edit regex/mkh and
    remove the line that sets the PATH.  The dict client has been tested
    under Cygwin+Win98, but the dictd server has not.]

    NOTE: If you use an old version of flex, you may get errors.  Try
    upgrading flex.

3.  Install the client, server, and manual pages:

        make install

    NOTE: If you only built the client software in step 2, use
    'make install.dict' instead of 'make install'

4.  Install any databases you would like dict/dictd to utilize.  The
    database(s) should be installed in a location that the 'dictd'
    server process has access to.  The preformatted dictd-usable databases
    you need can be found at any of the following locations:

        ftp://ftp.dict.org/pub/dict/pre/               [most up to date]
        ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/faith/dict/pre/ [mirror]

    a)  Make a directory to contain the dictionary database(s).  We'll
        use '/opt/public/dict-dbs' for this EXAMPLE.

    b)  For the sake of this document and to get you up and running, let's
        say you're only interested in the Webster 1913 dictionary database.
        In that case, get the latest 'dict-web1913...' file from one of the
        locations above.

    c)  Unpackage the 'dict-web1913...' file and put the resulting files
        (see below) into /opt/public/dict-dbs (our EXAMPLE area...).

           web1913.dict.dz   The 'dictzip' format database
           web1913.index     The index of the database

5.  To setup a proper server, you will need to configure a dictd.conf
    file.  Please see the man page dictd.8 and the example .conf files
    included with the source code for an explanation of the syntax needed
    and other important details.  By default, dictd will try to find this
    file as '/etc/dictd.conf', however if you start 'dictd' with the
    '-c /your/path/to/your/conf/file/mydictd.conf', it will use that
    file as the configuration file instead.

    For our example, with our web1913 database in /opt/public/dict-dbs,
    a MINIMAL dictd.conf file would be:

        database web1913 { data "/opt/public/dict-dbs/web1913.dict.dz"
                          index "/opt/public/dict-dbs/web1913.index" }

6.  If you're installing this software for "intranet" use, you will want to
    setup a 'dict.conf' file which the client software (dict) uses to
    locate servers and such.  The syntax of the dict.conf file is not
    documented anywhere that I can find, however if you have your 'dictd'
    server running on the host named dict.company.com, then you should put
    the following line in your dict.conf file so that users of the 'dict'
    client do not have to specify '-h dict.company.com' each time they
    want to query dictd:

        server dict.company.com

7.  That's it really.  Now piece everything together, run your dictd and
    point it at your config file, and try running dict!

ADVANCED
========

1.  As of dictd-1.4.9, specifying --prefix=/usr/local to the configure
    script will NOT build binaries that look for config files (dictd.conf
    and dict.conf) in /usr/local/etc.  This is a known bug.  To get around
    this and to build binaries that look in a specific place you want
    (/usr/local/etc for example), edit Makefile.in and change the line
    reading:

        conf=    @etcdir@/

    to read:

        # NOTE THE TRAILING SLASH!
        conf=    /my/config/files/are/here/

    So to build binaries that look for config files in /usr/local/etc :

        # NOTE THE TRAILING SLASH!
        conf=    /usr/local/etc/

    Then run proceed with the installation steps above in INSTALLATION.

GENERAL EXTRA INSTALL HELP
==========================

If the above information all isn't very clear, here's a view of good
distributed environment's setup:

    /usr/local/sbin/dictd         # Accessible from all hosts on our net
    /usr/local/bin/dict           # Accessible from all hosts on our net
    /usr/local/etc/dictd.conf     # Accessible from all hosts on our net
    /usr/local/etc/dict.conf      # Accessible from all hosts on our net
    /usr/local/lib/dict-dbs       # Accessible from all hosts on our net

    /usr/local/etc/dictd.conf contains 2 lines:

        database web1913 { data "/opt/public/dict-dbs/web1913.dict.dz"
                          index "/opt/public/dict-dbs/web1913.index" }

    /usr/local/etc/dict.conf contains 1 line:

        server dict

This setup allows ANY host on the network to quickly and easily become
the dictd server.  All you have to do is setup a 'host alias' for the
name 'dict' to point at whatever host you want to be the dictd server
and then start dictd on that host.
 
NOTE:  I had to install the dictd.conf and dict.conf in that location
       BY HAND.  This is not done automatically for you.
