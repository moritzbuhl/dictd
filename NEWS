Version 1.9.14, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  6 Jun 2004 21:18:19 +0300

  dictd:
    - fixed: SHOW INFO command sends incorrectly formatted data
      to the client if
      the information about database was set using 'info' keyword.
      Affected versions: 1.9.12-1.9.13

    - 'dictd' opens a log file (-L option) before releasing root priviledges.
      As a result log file can be created in /var/log directory.
      Log file and syslog are opened once.

      Error messages of sanity checks are written to log file (or syslog)
      but the stderr.

    - --listen-to <ip> option binds a socket to the specified address.
      See dictd.8 for details.

    - SIGUSR1  causes  dictd  to unload databases.
      Then dictd returns 420 status (instead of 220).
      See dictd.8 for details

    - exit status of child processes is written to log
      if '--log server' is specified.

  dictfmt:
    - fixed: 'dictfmt --locale <8bit-locale>' works incorrectly
      and may assert(3) on platforms
      having no 'mbrlen' function (FreeBSD-4).
      Affected versions: 1.9.12-1.9.13

    - -t option implies '--columns 0' to preserve original formatting

    - Special 00-database-XXX headwords do not affect 00-database-alphabet,
      i.e. only characters from "real" headwords
      are added to alphabet.
      This makes LEV search strategy a little faster,
      especially search in dictionaries
      containing non-Latin symbols only, for example, Cyrillic symbols.

  dict:
    - In case of error 'dict' exits with non-zero status.
      See Section EXIT STATUS in dict.1 for details.

  libmaa:
    - arg_argify function has been reimplemented because it is buggy.
      Affected 'dictd' versions: 1.4.9-1.9.13.
      More tests for arg_argify function have been added
      Testing program has also been reimplemeneted.
      See ChangeLog for details.

Version 1.9.13, by Aleksey Cheusov, 24 Mar 2004 11:32:53 +0200

  FIXED: if database has no 00-database-alphabet headword,
      "global" alphabet is built incorrectly. As a result
      dictd may work (FreeBSD does) incorrectly with LEV strategy.
      Affected versions: 1.9.12

  ADDED: plugin using libdbi library for implementing DICT database using
    SQL server. It is possible to specify custom search strategies
    by specifying SQL query.

    The following option are currently supported:

      driverdir       - path to DBI drivers
      drivername      - DBI driver name, such as pgsql, mysql, sqlite etc.
      option_host     - host to connect to
      option_port     - port to connect to
      option_dbname   - database name
      option_username - user name for authorizing to SQL server
      option_password - user password for authorizing to SQL server
      query_define    -        SQL query for implementing DEFINE command
      query_<strategy> - SQL query for implementing
           'strategy' (MATCH command).
           Note that 'strategy' is not limited to the "standard" ones.

    See the file example_plugin_dbi.conf for sample of how
      this plugin can be configured.

    SQL queries should return 1-column result by using SELECT command.
      %q sequence inside SQL query is expanded to user's query.
      %% is expanded to single % sign.

    This plugin gives a simplest way to implement editable
      dictionaries with a help
      of WEB interface, but with a read-only access to it
      using DICT protocol.

    NOTE! Unless libdbi library is not found on your system
    or you configure dictd with --disable-plugin option,
    'dictd' is linked with libdbi to resolve DBI driver's symbols.
    This should be fixed.

    NOTE! Connection to SQL database is made
    for every DEFINE/MATCH command.
    This slows down plugin and should be fixed.

Version 1.9.12, by Aleksey Cheusov, 10 Mar 2004 18:45:15 +0200

  Both dictd and Judy-plugin correctly implement
    the 'lev' strategy for utf-8 databases.
    For this purpose an additional headword 00-database-alphabet is
    created by dictfmt.
    So, if you often use 'lev' strategy with utf-8 dictionaries,
    rebuild them using dictfmt-1.9.12

  'nl_langinfo' function is used to detect
      whether dictd/dictfmt uses 8bit, utf-8, or C locale.

  dictd:
    - fixes

       SHOW SERVER command cuts off long database names

       crash on Solaris (and FreeBSD5 ?) due to
         toupper('255') returns 376 if utf-8 locale is set.

       LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE are set according to --locale.
         As a result date and time are logged using the C locale

    - MATCH|DEFINE *|! ignore invisible dictionaries.
         Now there is no reason to separate visible and invisible dictionaries
         by database_exit command.
         This simplifies the configuration file.

    - dictd --test|--test-file notifies about invalid database name

  dictl:

    - checks whether recode/iconv/konwert/locale commands are available

    - analyses PAGER variable to set a pager.

    - incorrect charset determination has been fixed

  dictfmt:

     - new option --break-headwords for use with --headword-separator, so
       each headword is written on its own line of the .dict file.

     - correctly wraps utf-8 input

     - new option --columns to set a number of columns for
      wrapping text. See dictfmt.1. By default this value is 72.
      All formats are affected and use the same default.

     - 00-database-XXX headwords are not copied to .dict file.
         The only exception is 00-database-short which should be copied
         to .dict file for older 'dictd'

  maa:
      new functions and #defines:
         'str_pool_init_position', 'str_pool_next_position',
         'str_pool_get_position', 'str_pool_readonly', 'str_pool_iterate',
         'str_pool_iterate_arg', 'STR_ITERATE' and 'STR_ITERATE_END'
         to iterate over strings in the string pool.

      fixed a bug in flags.c/flg_set function

  dictdplugin_judy:
      
      fixed: if a requested headword has more than one definition,
         DEFINE command always returns the first one

Version 1.9.11, by Aleksey Cheusov, 8 Dec 2003 20:55:31 +0200

  NEWS file added

  dictd:
    - dictd is compiled successfully on Solaris, MacOS-X(cc).
      A lot of warning and error messages appeared
      on 64-bit Opteron and Alpha were fixed.

    - fixed: 'suffix' strategy doesn't ignore characters other than
       alphanumeric and spaces. Affected versions: 1.9.1-1.9.10
    - A multi-lined short name of the database is truncated before sending
      to the client

    - patch by Michael Bunk <bunk at imn.htwk-leipzig.de} fixing:
       - a typo giving the incomprehensible failure message.
         Affected versions: 1.7.1-1.9.10

       - a typo resulting in 'dict --server-info' showing
           same compressed/uncompressed database sizes
         Affected versions: 1.9.1-1.9.10

       - broken AUTH command.
         Affected versions: 1.9.4-1.9.10

    - added: keyword "disable_strategy for disabling a specified strategy
             for a particular database.
             Strategies disabled by 'disable_strategy' keyword
             are not passed to plugins.

    - info/name keywords in 'database_virtual' section can handle
      entry name beginning with @ symbol in a similar way
      as 'database' and 'database_plugin' do.

    - dictd --pp <prog> sets a preprocessor for configuration file.

      If you run DICT server having a lot of dictionaries, you can preprocess
      configuration file using m4 (or cpp). This significantly reduces
      the size of configuration file.

      See dictd.8 and example_complex.conf.

  plugins:
    - the default directory for databases
      is passed to plugins (DICT_PLUGIN_INITDATA_DEFDBDIR)

    - plugin support is ported to systems having dlXXX API in libc (FreeBSD).

    - added: Judy-based plugin implementing fast "exact" and especially "lev"
      strategies. http://sf.net/projects/judy

      See example_complex.conf for the sample of usage.

      "prefix" strategy is also supported but
      for short queries it may be very slow. If you need not this,
      disable it by "disable_strategy" keyword.


  dict:
    - clientparse.y will accept "pager' as the pager.
      Thanks to Kirk Hilliard.

  dictfmt:
    - fixed: dictfmt -f doesn't work correctly if the first two lines are empty
      Affected versions of dictfmt:  1.6.1-1.9.10
    - fixed: --headword-separator doesn't work with -f, -p and -v formats

  dictl - wrapper script for "dict" that permits using utf-8 encoded
       dictionaries on a terminal that is not utf-8 aware.
       See dictl.1 for documentation.

  colorit - a script for colorizing the text input which can be used
       as dict pager. It is currently very simple but allows to make
       dict's output a bit nicer.
       See colorit.1 for documentation.

  documentation update

  other fixes and improvements

Version 1.9.10, by Aleksey Cheusov, 22 Jul 2003 19:37:22 +0300

  dictd-1.9.10 has been released.
  It is available for download from
  http://sf.net/projects/dict


  Major changes:
  - 'filter' option is fully implemented

  - Documentation update

  - fixes:
  - 'lev' strategy (pple' query doesn't match the word 'apple')
  Affected version: 1.4.9 - 1.9.9

  - 're' and 'regex' strategies
  ('^apple|orange' and '^apple\|orange' doesn't match a word 'orange')
  Affected versions: 1.4.9-1.9.9

  - incorrect spaces trimming
  Affected versions: 1.9.1-1.9.9

  - 'dictd' can be built with a regex engines
  other than local Henry Spencer's one.
  A system-wide regexec/regcomp are used by default.
  The first reason for this is that Henry Spencer's' implementation
  is not a fastest one. The second reason is that it doesn't support utf-8.

  - added: dictfmt -t. This simplifies rebuilding
  databases using 'dictunformat' utility.

  - System-wide wcXXX and mbXXX functions are used if present.

  - predefined DICT servers dict.org and alt0.dict.org 
  are not used by default by 'dict' client

Version 1.9.9, by Aleksey Cheusov, 14 Apr 2003 19:30:54 +0300

  dictd-1.9.9 has been released and it is available for download from
  http://sf.net/projects/dict

  Major changes:
  - dictd can be run from inetd.

  - cygwin improvements

  - dlopen is used instead of lt_dlopen on platforms where it is
  available (concerns to plugins)

  - bug fixes

Version 1.9.8, by Aleksey Cheusov, 27 Mar 2003 15:33:34 +0200

  dictd-1.9.8 has been released and is available for download from
  http://sf.net/projects/dict

  Major changes:
  - dictd can be compiled on CYGWIN without utf-8 support.
  If anyone manages to run dictd on Windows as a service, let me know.

  - UTF-8 support is optional. It is disabled on platforms which don't
  support 'iswalnum', 'iswspace' or 'towlower' functions.

  - fixes:
  - 'dictdb_free' plugin function is not called
  (affected versions: 1.9.1-1.9.7)
  - incorrect dzip format detection
  (affected versions: 1.4.9-1.9.7 (all?))
  - possible crash while reading too long COMMENT or FNAME fields of
  the dzip'ed file (dictzip doesn't create them)
  (affected versions: 1.4.9-1.9.7 (all?))

Version 1.9.7, by Aleksey Cheusov, 09 Mar 2003 20:03:42 +0200

  dictd-1.9.7 is released

  Download it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/dict.

  Major changes:

  - 'database_virtual' keyword in the configuration file
  specifies 'virtual' dictionary without database files.

  - 'database_plugin' keyword in the configuration file
  specifies plugin without database files.

  - 'info' keyword in the 'database specification'
  specifies the information about database. @ prefix is also supported
  and specifies an entry name.

  - dictd --add-strategy
  allows to implement (with a help of plugins)
  new strategies not available in 'dictd'.
  For example, 'revert' strategy may be implemented.
  By using '--with-strategy' and '--add-strategy' options
  it is possible to create DICT server with the set of strategies
  you need.

  - 'invisible' keyword in the configuration file
  allows to hide several databases.
  This may be useful if you use virtual databases.

  - 'string' in the configuration file can be continued between lines.

  - ./configure --with-nec-socks5
  With this option applied, programs will be linked with
  the NEC socks5 library

Version 1.9.6, by Aleksey Cheusov, 02 Mar 2003 14:19:37 +0200

  A bug fixing release is available for download
  from http://sf.net/projects/dict

  Changes:

  critical fix: dictd may crash on BMH search
  (substring, suffix and word strategies) because
  it accesses memory outside mmap'ed region.

  Affected versions: 1.4.9-1.9.5

Version 1.9.5, by Aleksey Cheusov, 23 Feb 2003 20:28:32 +0200

  If the 'name' keyword is used in database section, and
  it doesn't begin with '@', dictd may crash on SIGHUP.
  Affected versions: 1.9.1-1.9.4.

  The following is the patch. This patch is the only difference between
  dictd-1.9.4 and dictd-1.9.5 releases.

Version 1.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, 15 Sep 2002 20:54:30 -0400

  - better 8bit, UTF-8, and i18n support
  - dictfmt is now part of the dictd tarball
  - dictd supports plugins
  - dictd will use system libz when possible

Version 1.7.1
  (broken support for 8bit dictionaries)

Version 1.7.0, by Rick Faith, 3 May 2002 10:02:11 -0400

  I've released dictd 1.7.0.  It's the same as 1.6.93, except:
     1) The locale for dictd defaults to "C".  So if you've been using
        LC_ALL, you probably need to use the new --locale option.  I know
        this is a kludge and that dictd must move to Unicode/UTF-8/UCS-4.
     2) The dict pager is closed on fatal errors.  This may help prevent
        the screen corruption under Debian when dict is used with less
        and there is a fatal error.  Please let me know.
        3) Log output no longer filters the 8th bit.

  I've also updated the databases on www.dict.org to the most recent ones
  in use by Debian, and I've put those in ftp.dict.org:/pub/dict/pre.  I'm
  still using web1913 and wn instead of gcide.  However, gcide is
  available for testing if you use "dict -ugcide -kgcide -dgcide" [this
  may be removed in the future, but try it out now; note that older client
  may not pass authenticate unless you also specify -h].  Please don't
  hard code a "user gcide gcide" in any example or distributed .dictrc
  files.  Thanks.

  (no information available)

Version 1.4.8
  (no information available)

Version 1.4.5, by Rick Faith, 23 Feb 1998 20:00:23 -0500

  The DICT Development Group (www.dict.org) announces the dictd-1.4.x
  distribution, containing client/server software implementing the
  Dictionary Server Protocol, as described in RFC 2229.

  The Dictionary Server Protocol (DICT) is a TCP transaction based
  query/response protocol that allows a client to access dictionary
  definitions from a set of natural language dictionary databases.

  dict(1) is a client which can access DICT servers from the command line.

  dictd(8) is a server which supports the DICT protocol.

  dictzip(1) is a compression program which creates compressed files in the
  gzip format (see RFC 1952).  However, unlike gzip(1), dictzip(1) compresses
  the file in pieces and stores an index to the pieces in the gzip header.
  This allows random access to the file at the granularity of the compressed
  pieces (currently about 64kB) while maintaining good compression ratios
  (within 5% of the expected ratio for dictionary data).  dictd(8) uses files
  stored in this format.
